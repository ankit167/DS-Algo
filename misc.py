# Given a music player with 'n' songs. Play a song randomly, making

# terminate once all songs have been played.
#
# Approach: Find a random song in the list. Play the song. Swap the
#           song with the last song in the list. Reduce length of the list
#           by 1. Iterate with this logic until the length of the list gets
#           reduced to 0.
#
# T(n)- O(n)
#
# Note: The hashmap approach (to check whether a song has been played before,
#       if not, hash it) might not work, since the random function might
#       might return an already played song again and again, leading to
